<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is something about animal friendships that warms our hearts. They do not allow themselves to get hung up on the same issues that we do. Their friendships transcend all of the usual boundaries. While there are some who believe that cats are inherently unfriendly, this story shows otherwise. The calico you are about to meet is quite the adventurous type.</p>

<p>Can you believe that the cat immediately decided to visit the enclosure that was full of lynx? This wouldn’t be most animals’ first choice. You would think that this story would end up with the lynx enjoying a free meal and carrying on with their day. We wouldn’t fault you one bit, either. The lynx was not about to devour their new friend, though.</p>

<p>In fact, they hit it off right away and got along famously. The zookeepers were rather concerned, though. They wanted to make sure that no harm came to the innocent calico. This St Petersburg zoo did not want to be in the news for the wrong reasons. The cat was eventually removed from the enclosure before the lynx had a chance to change their mind about the new visitor.</p>

<p>This was probably for the best. You simply never know how these situations are going to turn out. The next day, they realized that keeping these two apart was going to be easier said than done. The cat made their way back into the enclosure once more. Dusya is the cat’s name now and she is best pals with Linda. Their friendship made them the talk of the town.</p>

<p>They have been friends for over a decade now. Luckily for us, the zoo has been willing to share all kinds of photos and videos with the rest of the world. We cannot get enough of their connection. Their level of harmony is something that we should all be striving for. These two are close friends and they do not allow their superficial differences to keep them apart.</p>

<p>What do you think of this unlikely friendship? There is a lot to be learned from them. They are not willing to allow society’s hangups to deter their friendship. We could all stand to take a lesson from these two. We love to see Dusya and Linda together and hope that they continue to share lots and lots of pictures. Who knew that a zoo break in could lead to such an awesome connection?</p>
